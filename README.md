End-To-End Trainable Model for Text Recognition

We implement an end-to-end trainable model for character-level word recognition. The model architecture stacks convolutional layers, followed by RNN layers that output into a transcription layer that leverages CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss to train the model end-to-end. 


The model is implemented in Python / Tensorflow.
